# PRODIGY_CS_04
This is a cyber-sec related project done by myself with various references and self study for  the completion of task given as part of an internship from prodigy_Infotech.
This project covers a simple keylogger code which logs every keys pressed since the code starts running on a system and saves it to a txt file.
